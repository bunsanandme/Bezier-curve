# Bezier-curve
Graphical builder for quadratic Bezier curves in the Cartesian plane in C++/Qt

>What can I do?

You can build Bezier curves on three points here and just look at them for now.

>Is there any way to change the coordinate values?

If you need a different coordinate range or step size, just add the values you need to the config.

## What's next?

I'm going to add:
* The ability to build a large number of points
* fix bugs with drawing
* a little beautiful design :)
* output of the curve equation
* Animations for building using the Casteljo method

And another thing: I wrote this under Linux, if there are any problems or comments, I will be happy to correct them
